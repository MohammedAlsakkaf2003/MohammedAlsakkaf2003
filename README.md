- ⚡ Fun fact:  Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Two pump blood to the gills,
-               where it picks up oxygen, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body.
-               When they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating,
-               which is why they prefer to crawl rather than swim!
